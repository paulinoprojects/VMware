## Cisco Identidy Services Engine (ISE)
- A security solution that helps organizations control and manage who can access their computer networks and resources. 
- It acts like a gatekeeper, making sure only authorized users and devices can connect to the network while keeping out unauthorized ones. 
- ISE checks the identity of users and devices, like laptops or smartphones, before allowing them to access the network. It enforces security policies and ensures that users and devices meet certain requirements, like having the right credentials or meeting security standards. 
- In a nutshell, Cisco ISE helps maintain network security by controlling who gets in and what they can do once they're connected.
